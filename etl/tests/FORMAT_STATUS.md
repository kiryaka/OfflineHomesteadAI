## 🎯 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Document Formats (Next Priority)
1. **RTF** - Install pandoc system dependency
2. **EML** - Fix email partitioner configuration
3. **DOC** - Needs unstructured support
4. **EPUB** - Needs unstructured support
5. **MSG** - Needs unstructured support

### Phase 2: OCR Implementation (Future Work)
1. **Install Tesseract** - System dependency
2. **PDF Images** - OCR for image-based PDFs
3. **Image Formats** - JPG, PNG, TIFF, etc.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to see current status:

```bash
cd etl/tests
python run_text_cleaning_tests.py
```

This will show:
- ✅ Currently supported formats with validation results
- ⏳ Pending formats with implementation requirements
- 🔍 OCR pending formats with setup requirements

## 📝 Notes

- All currently supported formats pass all 9 validation tests
- Universal cleaning approach works consistently across formats
- Format-specific cleaning rules are applied when needed
- Easy to add new formats by following existing patterns
